# RYP 2025-2026 Season Wrapped

Interactive NFL picks analysis dashboard for the RYP league's 2025-26 season. Built with Streamlit, Plotly, and scikit-learn.

## What's Inside

- **Season Summary** — standings, race recap, and shoutouts heading into the Super Bowl
- **Team Performance** — straight-up records, ATS records, home/away cover rates, spread impact, and weekly favorite coverage
- **Bias & Patterns** — most picked teams, favorite pick rates, herd mentality, PAA heatmap, leaderboard race, hot/cold streaks, and consensus vs contrarian analysis
- **Pick Predictor** — per-player ML models (logistic regression) that predict which team you'd pick given game conditions
